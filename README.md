# Suricata Alert System

## Project Overview

The Suricata Alert System is a robust application designed to process and manage alerts generated by the Suricata intrusion detection system. It offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to network threats.

## Features
- Real-time alert processing
- User-friendly web interface
- Advanced filtering and search options
- Alert management and tagging
- Integration with external notification systems

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development and scalability. Key components include:
- **Alert Processor**: Handles incoming alerts and performs necessary actions based on rules.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a dashboard for users to view and manage alerts.
- **Database**: Stores alerts and user configurations.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morgandotpy/Suricata_Alert_System.git
   cd Suricata_Alert_System
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure the environment** by setting up the environment variables as specified in the `.env.example` file. Rename it to `.env`.
4. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

After starting the application, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the dashboard. From there, you can view and manage alerts.

## Requirements
- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB (for alert storage)
- Docker (optional, for easier deployment)

## Future Roadmap
- **Q1 2026**: Implement machine learning algorithms for threat prediction.
- **Q2 2026**: Expand alert management features to include automation rules.
- **Q3 2026**: Enhance reporting capabilities with customizable reports.
- **Q4 2026**: Community-driven feature requests and improvements.
